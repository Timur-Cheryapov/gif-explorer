## About The Project
[--> Get fresh APK file here <--](GIF.apk)

GIF is an experimental app for exploring most popular GIFs at the moment.
You can easily swipe liked or disliked GIFs to sort them into different categories like in Tinder app!

This app was made as a training project. The main focus was to create smooth animations of the stack of GIFs.

## Known issues
- Sometiems the animation during the swipe will freeze before the previous animation has finished. The investigation is being conducted.
- Sometimes the name of the first GIF on the launch will be wrong. But after the swipe everything is alright.

Features that might look like bugs:

Due to simplicity of the app no liked or disliked GIFs are saved. The selection is saved only when the app is running.
Loading GIFs is not optimised, therefore with the low quality of the internet connection it takes more time to fully load GIFs.
Seen GIFs are not memorized.
